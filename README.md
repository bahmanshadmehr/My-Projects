# About Me
My name is Bahman Shadmehr. Currently I'm 19 years old. I'm studying computer engineering at BASU (Bu Ali Sina University of Iran)  
I love programming but mostly I love python, Django and telepot.  
I also have some experience in Android programming, C# programming, Front-End Development and more...  
If you are an experienced team i really would like to join you and work with you and mostly learn from you :)  
I'm currently working on a Company Application which I will put it here in the future and an online course website which you can see it's link below.  
<br />
Anyway, I'm going to update this part in the future. I hope you enjoy my codes  
  
  
# Web Crawler:
It's a simple web crawler which crawls all of the application in an Iranian android applications marketplace. I have finished this script in Tuesday, April 04, 2017. But in the future I'm going to write some algorithms for extracting some information’s from the data that I already have from this script.

# Online Course website:
In this project I'm trying to create an online programming course website. I will add some other functionalities to it based on what i need.  
The project is in progress and it’s based on Django. So you can see different apps in it. I’m not going to put each app in a different repository.

# Laser Defender Unity Game:
This little game is my second experience in Unity Game Engine. It's a simple game and it’s really not special but I like it because I liked unity. And also it was a good experience in working with C#. But It’s not finished yet. I'm adding some new functionalities to the game. Finally I will build it for the web and I will upload it for you to enjoy it :)

# Conquer Board Unity Game:
This Project was actually my first Unity project. It is a multi-player board game. But it is not a network game and the players should play it only by one system. In the future I will add this functionality to it.  
But you can enjoy it right now if you like :)  
I've used c# for this project and the good part about the projects is some of my codes. You can read more about it in the link below.

# Store Bot(Telegram Bot Using Telepot, Python):
This project is a simple Telegram Bot. It actually is my first experience of using Telepot. It was really fun and I really enjoyed it.   This project has two functions than for using the bot you can change it. One of them is for getting the catogory and another one is for getting data from a category.  
it also has a function for submitting the order that you can change for writing it in the way that you like.  
I hope you enjoy it :)
